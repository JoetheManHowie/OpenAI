    "## Notes on the parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "For text generation we have the class \"Completion\" which we can use to generate text from prompts with the method \n",
    "create(): The following is a descriptive list of the parameters of create()  (see ref [6]). \n",
    "\n",
    "__Note:__ You will likely just need the paprameters that are in the example below.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. __model:__ < str > ID of the model to use. You can use the List models API to see all of your available models, or see our Model overview for descriptions of them. *Required*.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. __prompt:__ < str >, list of str> [Default = <|endoftext|>] The prompt(s) to generate completions for, encoded as a string, array of strings, array of tokens, or array of token arrays. Note that <|endoftext|> is the document separator that the model sees during training, so if a prompt is not specified the model will generate as if from the beginning of a new document. *Optional*.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. __suffix:__ < str > [Default = null] The suffix that comes after a completion of inserted text. *Optional*.\n",
    "    \n",
    "4. __max_tokens:__ < int > [Default = 16] The maximum number of tokens to generate in the completion. The token count of your prompt plus max_tokens cannot exceed the model's context length. Most models have a context length of 2048 tokens (except for the newest models, which support 4096). *Optional*.\n",
    "    \n",
    "5. __temperature:__ < float > [Default = 1] What sampling temperature to use. Higher values means the model will take more risks. Try 0.9 for more creative applications, and 0 (argmax sampling) for ones with a well-defined answer. We generally recommend altering this or top_p but not both. *Optional*.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. __top_p:__ < float > [Default = 1] An alternative to sampling with temperature, called nucleus sampling, where the model considers the results of the tokens with top_p probability mass. So 0.1 means only the tokens comprising the top 10% probability mass are considered. We generally recommend altering this or temperature but not both. *Optional*.\n",
    " \n",
    "6. __n:__ < int > [Default = 1] How many completions to generate for each prompt. Note: Because this parameter generates many completions, it can quickly consume your token quota. Use carefully and ensure that you have reasonable settings for max_tokens and stop. *Optional*.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. __stream:__ < boolean > [Default = False] Whether to stream back partial progress. If set, tokens will be sent as data-only server-sent events as they become available, with the stream terminated by a data: [DONE] message. *Optional*.\n",
    "    \n",
    "8. __logprobs:__ < int > [Default = null] Include the log probabilities on the logprobs most likely tokens, as well the chosen tokens. For example, if logprobs is 5, the API will return a list of the 5 most likely tokens. The API will always return the logprob of the sampled token, so there may be up to logprobs+1 elements in the response. The maximum value for logprobs is 5. If you need more than this, please contact us through our Help center and describe your use case. *Optional*.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. __echo:__ < boolean > [Default = False] Echo back the prompt in addition to the completion *Optional*.\n",
    "    \n",
    "10. __stop:__ < str or array > [Default = null] Up to 4 sequences where the API will stop generating further tokens. The returned text will not contain the stop sequence. *Optional*.\n",
    "\n",
    "11. __presence_penalty:__ < float > [Default = 0] Number between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values penalize new tokens based on whether they appear in the text so far, increasing the model's likelihood to talk about new topics. *Optional*.\n",
    "    \n",
    "12. __frequency_penalty:__ < float > [Default = 0] Number between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values penalize new tokens based on their existing frequency in the text so far, decreasing the model's likelihood to repeat the same line verbatim. *Optional*.\n",
    "\n",
    "13. __best_of:__ < int > [Default = 1] Generates best_of completions server-side and returns the \"best\" (the one with the highest log probability per token). Results cannot be streamed. When used with n, best_of controls the number of candidate completions and n specifies how many to return – best_of must be greater than n. Note: Because this parameter generates many completions, it can quickly consume your token quota. Use carefully and ensure that you have reasonable settings for max_tokens and stop. *Optional*.\n",
    "    \n",
    "1. __logit_bias:__ < dict > [Default = null] Modify the likelihood of specified tokens appearing in the completion. Accepts a json object that maps tokens (specified by their token ID in the GPT tokenizer) to an associated bias value from -100 to 100. You can use this tokenizer tool (which works for both GPT-2 and GPT-3) to convert text to token IDs. Mathematically, the bias is added to the logits generated by the model prior to sampling. The exact effect will vary per model, but values between -1 and 1 should decrease or increase likelihood of selection; values like -100 or 100 should result in a ban or exclusive selection of the relevant token. As an example, you can pass {\"50256\": -100} to prevent the <|endoftext|> token from being generated. *Optional*.\n",
    "    \n",
    "1. __user:__ < str > [Default = null] A unique identifier representing your end-user, which can help OpenAI to monitor and detect abuse. *Optional*.\n"

      "\n",
      "My greatest strength comes through working with others as it allows us collectively to push boundaries beyond our individual potentials which yields more sustainable results rooted within collaboration rather than competition. In addition, innovation within this process helps unlock creative solutions leading toward development opportunities that may not have occurred monolithically- thus producing advantageous outcomes for whoever may benefit from them . Therefore working together truly is better than solely attempting initial success individually . \n",

    "## Examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "*Prompt:* Which insects is the best and why? please provide an essay style argument.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Response:* The best insect is a highly subjective choice, as there are many species of insect with different qualities and traits that can be admirable in some sense. However, if one was to make a general case for the 'best' insect, it is likely that bees would take precedence. \n",
    "\n",
    "Bees are arguably the most important pollinators on Earth, as they play an integral role in maintaining healthy levels of biodiversity across ecosystems - something which has become increasingly threatened due to global climate change. Without bee populations providing their crucial pollination services, many plants and other organisms could quickly fail without them or suffer from reduced genetic diversity - leading to negative consequences up and down food webs. \n",
    "The honeybee is also renowned for its ability to build intricate nests using wax secreted from its abdomen glands where it will then organize itself into hives run by a Queen Bee who passes her genes on through successive generations in order to maintain a strong colony—a feat not easily replicated by any other insects or animals alike! Other species such as bumblebees may also offer unique ecological advantages depending on geographical locales - allowing them access into flowers or niches inaccessible by honeybees that may otherwise go unnoticed when considering crop-pollination services.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to their vital ecological benefits bees can also provide great economic value through their production of honey and other related products such as royal jelly used primarily within the health industry (with reported antiinflammatory properties). Similarly, wax harvested from comb structures often provides further commercial opportunities around candle making and waterproofing applications among others!  Therefore our relationship with these insects is symbiotic at best – positively developing alongside each other despite challenges associated with decline in wild bee populations throughout recent years brought about largely due innovatively designed monoculture crops heavily reliant on artificial fertilizers instead of natural pollination sources amongst others factors posed against these invaluable creatures but still remaining resilient all the same! \n",
    "\n",
    " Ultimately this leaves us with little doubt when considering why bees should be regarded so high amongst any list – providing both environmental stability coupled along productive economic gains through careful management practices sustainably crafted around protecting our buzzing friends; truly making them iconic symbols within modern times no matter what your opinion might be .\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "*Prompt:* Which insects is the best and why? please provide an essay style argument.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Response:* Insects have been a vast and diverse group of organisms since their emergence on the planet. Each species has its own unique adaptations that make it well suited for different ecosystems and environments. When asked which insect is the best, the answer is subjective; there are so many amazing creatures to choose from! However, if we must choose just one, I would argue that bees are perhaps one of the most impressive insects out there.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bees play an integral role in our environment through pollination. This process allows flowers to reproduce, sending seeds throughout various habitats and contributing to global biodiversity. Bees also provide us with delicious honey through their complex social organization structures within hives; they've even been used by humans as domesticated livestock for thousands of years! In addition, bees have evolved a remarkable range of elaborate behaviors such as waggle dances and pollen gathering techniques that allow them to maintain efficient levels of productivity within their colonies despite harsh conditions or sudden changes in temperature or weather patterns. \n",
    "\n",
    "One thing that makes bees so remarkable is their level of commitment to helping other members in the hive: worker bees will often risk their lives gathering nectar from plants while soldier bees protect against potential threats brought about by predators or parasites invading colonies during winter months when resources become scarce (a process known as “clustering”). Furthermore, recent studies suggest that honeybees may even be capable of problem solving through communication amongst hive members: they can adaptively form cognitive maps based on visual stimuli alone due to specialized neurons forming pathways between relevant sections in brains! \n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, it is difficult not to admire how fascinating these tiny creatures can be (and are!). Their indefatigable work ethics coupled with their amazing physical and social feats rank them among some top-tier insects out there--not only do they provide us with a precious commodity but without them humanity would be facing an immense loss when it comes down preserving our current ecosystems across landmasses.\n",

Inside these walls, our kindhearted giant turtles will guide you on a journey of spiritual growth and connection with nature.\n",

    "We offer plenty of calming activities and invitations to meditate, such as yoga classes on a carpet of moss, early-morning strolls amongst the trees, accapella singing around the bonfire, and an impressive array of pottery making classes. Guests can also explore the Monestary’s beautiful greenhouse filled with medicinal plants.\n",
